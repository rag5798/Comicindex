                        <p>At the Satan's Saints' hideout, Ghost Rider is mesmerized into telling Curly how he became the Ghost Rider. After recounting the events that led to his current predicament, Ghost Rider passes out. Curly prepares a sacrifice and summons Satan, who reveals Curly to be the reincarnation of Crash Simpson, who has promised to bring the soul of Johnny Blaze in order to be restored to life. However, this proves impossible as Roxanne Simpson's pure love for Johnny prevents the ritual from commencing. Satan orders Crash to take the soul of his daughter, before changing him back into Curly and leaving.</p>

                        <p>Once upon a time, Johnny Blaze made a deal with the Devil...and to no one's surprise but his own, he got shafted. Now trapped in hell, with the Spirit of Vengeance bonded to his immortal soul and weighing him down, Johnny may have finally found a way out. But at what cost? From the depths of Hell to the glittering spires of Heaven, the Ghost Rider rides again in his first ongoing series in nearly a decade, blazing new trails and dispensing fiery vengeance in his wake. The demonic team of Daniel Way, Mark Texeira and Javier Saltares reunite to put ol' Flamehead back in the saddle where he belongs. Ready or not, here he comes! </p>

He goes to open a bureau that contains some records she is asking about and when he opens it is swarmed by snakes.Today, Wally West is shooting baskets on a basketball court at high speed. He takes a break and goes to talk to Linda at the sidelines. She is still working on her cult story. Some of her papers are caught by the wind and Wally catches them, seeing a photo of Linda with an X through it and a warning to stay away. Wally asks her about it and she tells him threats like this one are part of being a reporter.
                            Wally sees something speed past, just a blur. He runs Linda home and finds Iris Allen there. Iris tells Wally that she is from the 30th century and that her grandson Bart Allen is lost in the time stream and his speed powers are burning non-stop, rapidly aging him. Wally tells Iris that he saw Bart and that he will find Bart and help him.
