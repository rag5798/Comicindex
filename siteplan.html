        Welcome to My comic Collection: I want to add a welcome message with an explanation of what the website is. The explanation will say whether a comic book collector or just a hobbyist with thousands of comics its difficult to keep track of where a certain book is located. Keeping track of your collection is essential and with this index you can track your books. Another important aspect of collecting is price and grade. With this you can see the price of your books and supply a picture so you can show them off or look at the grade all without having to grab it from your collection.

        This page will contain a picture of some of my comics with the price and pictures. This will have the details of the comic under each. I donâ€™t know what I am going to put here so I will fill them out as I need to.

        This page will feature my favorite super hero from each major publisher, namely Marvel, DC, and Independent. The marvel character is Ghost Rider and it will say Originally when Blaze transformed into Ghost Rider, his body changed but not the clothes he was wearing. In his new incarnation, this is different and his clothes take on a different appearance with a spiked leather jacket and chains. As Ghost Rider, he can cause his motorcycle to transform and surround itself with hellfire or he can create a new cycle from pure hellfire. He is also capable of projecting hellfire as a weapon. His hellfire "burns the soul" without leaving physical injuries on the victim and its effects have been seen as similar to the "Penance Stare." I like ghost rider because of his chains he uses as a weapon and his motorcylcle and originally a horse. I think he has some pretty interesting variations including cosmic Ghost Rider who gets his powers from Galactus. This will include an image of ghost rider and my comic of him. My most expensive book I own is a miles morales that is worth $400. I would add and image of this comic and details of the comic.

        Wireframes

      <p>
        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>         
        On this page I would like to introduce the website and display the logo. 
        I want to introduce my goal, which will go something along the line of 
        This site will allow you to organize your Comics and display a picture so 
        you can show off your best comics and look at the quality of comic you have as 
        you search. This will help someone search for if they have a comic and what the 
        condition is. The header will include the logo, Home page link, Collection link, 
        Featured link, and About Me link. This would be followed by a hero with the images 
        at the bottom of this section. Then I will have a section of my intro and goal with
        my eBay shop page either embedded in this section or just below. Then the footer 
        would include my eBay social and my name and website title.
      </p>

      <h3>Collection</h3>
      <p>         
        On this page I would like to Display a collection of comics by displaying the picture of a comic, 
        the name, details, and price directly below the picture. 
        The main content will be 2 columns of these sections that continue down the page. 
        This allows you to look through your collection and complete our site goal of showing 
        off the comics and searching through your collection. I can link my eBay again and show 
        my store front at the bottom while keeping the header and footer the same. 
      </p>

        I would like this page to display my favorite characters from marvel, DC, and independent artists. 
        This would include the group then the character, a picture of the character, details 
        about the character and a comic book that I have of the character. 
        This would be in a similar profile to the collection page but this would have the 
        marvel bolded then the character bellow that which would be slightly smaller, with the 
        paragraph bellow. The image of the comic would be next to the bolded heading.
